	  <h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods. The Scientific Investigation & Ethics in Computing</h2>
	  
	  	<p>
			Unit 1 educated me on the purpose of research; research is twofold for any student, regardless of the level they are pursuing as it can help improve critical thinking, understanding of a particular topic and most importantly, make evidence-based decisions. Research is classified into three purposes; exploration, description and explanation (Singh, 2019). </p>
	  	<p>
			The use of the scientific method for research is classified in two categories; deductive and inductive with the major difference being the order of the process. Deductive reasoning starts with the theory, developing a hypothesis, collecting and analyzing data to test the hypothesis, whereas inductive reasoning starts with collecting and analyzing data, and stating the hypothesis (Decarlo, 2018).

	  <h2>Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review & the Research Proposal</h2>
	  	<p>
			Unit 2 focused on the research question and I’ve learnt that it focusses on the individual’s inquiry and narrows down the field of research in order to ensure the relevance, interest and specificity of the research being conducted (Singh, 2019). The research question also ensures that the researcher has appropriate guidance when making decisions, however most importantly it reduces the need for constant reevaluation.
		</p>
	  	<p>
			The literature review is a collection of relevant data on the topic of choice in order to create a summary of published and existing data from the field from experts and individuals who have conducted and analyzed research (Snyder, 2019). The high-level purpose of the literature review is providing sufficient background information to ensure that there is adequate evidence to support a hypothesis. The literature review topic chosen was “A Review on Machine Learning Tools and Techniques in Local Transportation Systems in New Orleans, Louisiana.”

		<p></p>
	  
	  <h2>Unit 3: Methodology & Research Methods</h2>
	  	<p>
			Research methods are the methods in which data is collected and analyzed during the data gathering phase of a project, most times the method of research is directly related to the research question posed by the researcher (Henderson, 2015). The methods are classified into qualitative, quantitative and a combination of both. The qualitative method consists of collecting and analyzing non numerical data in an attempt to understand individuals’ experiences and opinions, it is particularly useful to answer questions of “how” or “why,” and is particularly useful for real world problems (Tenny et al, 2022). 
		</p>
	  	<p>
			The quantitative method however, deals with statistics acquired through surveys and questionnaires in an attempt to find patterns, make predictions and finding the central tendency of data (Rana et al, 2021). Research Design however deals with the way in which the research is conducted and how the findings are acquired, it includes the “how” in order to undertake research for the chosen topic (Khanday & Khanam, 2023). There are two types of research design, exploratory research and conclusive research. Exploratory research deals with a selected topic narrowed down sufficiently however there is not a clear definition of what the issue is, however the outcome of this type of research is ultimately to further the understanding or provide additional information. Conclusive research aims to give a definitive answer to a more focused area (BRM, n.d.).

	  <h2>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups & Observations</h2>
	  	<p>
			Unit 4 expanded on the qualitative and quantitative data collection methods which include observation, focus groups and case studies. Each of these had its strengths and offered unique viewpoints which I will expand on. 
		</p>
	  	<p>
			The observation method focuses on describing the behavior of an object until there has been some discernable insight achieved (Kumar, 2023). The observation method is the most common method used, as it is a subconscious act that occurs, even outside of professional and academic settings.
		</p>
	  	<p>
			The focus group method is primarily a qualitative research method where a group of people from similar demographics are collectively interviewed in an attempt to have open dialogue and allow for lines of communication to occur for collaboration between all participants (Jarvis & Barberena, 2008).
		</p> 
	 	 <p>	
			The case study is a very specific study of a particular topic with the aim of generalizing across a larger topic. It is used for defining scenarios, rather than analyzing them in great detail (Gerring, 2004).

	  <h2>Unit 5: Interviews, Survey Methods & Questionnaire Design</h2>
	  	<p>
			The interview method is a qualitative method of research that involves asking open ended questions to an individual or group of individuals in an attempt to garner insight into the particular topic (Trainor, 2012). The use of open-ended questions allows for a dialogue between the interviewer and interviewee to allow for a more casual interaction to occur (Qu & Dumay, 2011). Surveys are an alternative method of gathering information from large groups of individuals which can be summarized and used to create visualizations for an easy way of expressing large amounts of information (Anheier, & Scherer, 2015). 
		</p>
	  	<p>
	  		The questionnaire design is important to the type of research being conducted; specifically the type of questions whether it be opened or closed in order to remove any ambiguity to the respondent which minimizes bias (Malhotra, 2006).

	  <h2>Unit 6: Quantitative Methods - Descriptive & Inferential Statistics</h2>
	  	<p>
			Unit 6 deals with quantitative methods of research which uses numerical variables which have been collected in order to analyze and gain results to make decisions (Apuke, 2017). The importance of quantitative research to the individual and topic undertaken is the fact that the data obtained is objective and reliable, which is used for making informed decisions. The reliability of this data is due to standardized procedures and statistical techniques which can be replicated (Ghanad, 2023). Through the use of statistics and visualization techniques, data can be summarized and valuable information can be garnered. 
		</p>
	  	<p>
			There are a variety of data collection methods which can be used, however there are six major types which include; questionnaires, interviews, focus groups tests, observations and secondary data (which is data utilized from another source. The use of multiple forms of data collection is ideal as it allows for a mixed method to ensure that there are complementary strengths, and no overlapping weaknesses (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2013).

	  <h2>Unit 7: Inferential Statistics & Hypthesis Testing</h2>
	  	<p>
			Inferential statistics and hypothesis testing are crucial following the collection of raw data through the use of surveys and questionnaires. The information collected is only useful when processed and analyzed to make informed decisions. The attached worksheets contained samples of data which were analyzed using Microsoft Excel’s data analytics tools in order to calculate the mode, median and mean of data sets. In addition to this statistical data, hypothesis testing was accomplished including one tailed, and two tailed t-tests and F-tests. Upon the calculation of these values, interpretations of the data were accomplished and my findings were noted.

	  <h2>Unit 8: Data Analysis and Visualization</h2>
	  	<p>
		Unit 8 went into a more in-depth discussion between qualitative and quantitative data specifically, what the findings from each type of data gathering include. Qualitative data includes observations and information which cannot be quantified or used for statistical interpretation, whereas quantitative data includes statistics which can be quantified through visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts and histograms as a few examples.

	  <h2>Unit 9: Validity & Generalisability in Research</h2>
	  	<p>
		The final set of worksheets were completed this week and are attached below with my interpretations included under the visualizations. The learning portion of this week consisted of research validity, reliability and generalizability, which put together are unofficially called the three gold criteria due to their importance in building trust and allowing for meaningful interpretations which lead to informed decision making occurring (Leung, 2015).

	  <h2>Unit 10: Research Writing</h2>
	  	<p>
			Unit 10 consisted of research writing and its importance which range from increasing your knowledge to developing critical thinking. The importance of this was focused on the final dissertation as it is primarily a research document. Furthermore, being a competent writer will allow for publishing of work to journals and peer reviewed journals. Finally, this week the completed statistical worksheets were submitted for feedback as well as the research proposal presentation.

		</p>
	  
	  <h2>Unit 11: Going Forward: Professional Development & My ePortfolio</h2>
	  	<p>
		Unit 11 focused on two forms of development; my ePortfolio and my professional development, as the importance of a good ePortfolio was stressed as it can be used as a resume or snapshot of my accomplishments in the computing industry. Feedback was also received on the statistical worksheets. 
		</p>
		<p>
		  In addition to the development listed in my ePortfolio the completion of the SWOT analysis, personal development and the action plan have been completed and are linked below. The major issues I experienced was the lack of proper planning and impromptu work trips to remote work sites (Helidecks in deep water rigs) where personal electronic devices are not allowed due to the sensitive work environment and the safety risk associated with working there. In addition to this was the effect it had on submitting required work at a timely manner, meaning I was unable to utilize my allotted time to ensure that all work was completed satisfactorily. I tried my best to complete all the assignments however some were rushed due to a last-minute assignment to a platform for 3 weeks, meaning I would miss my deadline.

	  <h2>Unit 12: Project Management & Managing Risk</h2>
	  	<p>
			The final unit deals with project management and managing risk. Project management allows for a seamless transition between different aspects of the project by creating a step by step process and ensuring that tasks which are not reliant on one another can be done simultaneously to ensure that the project is achieved in an efficient manner. Furthermore project management can ensure that there is an effective use of resources to ensure that there is little to no wastage occurring, and in addition to having a plan, risk can be reduced due to the preparation of the project as mitigating circumstances can be included to reduce an extended down time, should something go wrong.
