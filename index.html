				    <h4><b>Covariance Pearson Correlation</b></h4>
					    <p>Pearsonâ€™s correlation is the deviation of the two values (x and y) which are multiplied, summed and divided by the total number of pairs of values minus 1 (n-1). This helps to calculate the difference between two variables and calculate whether the correlation is high or not, a score of 1 or near 1 indicates that there is a strong relationship between the 2 variables, while a score of -1 or near -1 indicates the absence or weak relationship between the 2 variables. From the code provided and following manipulation, it was found that reducing the number of points on the graph will reduce the accuracy of the mean for both data1 and data2 as there would be less values to be used to calculate the mean. 
					    </p>
				    <h4><b>Linear Regression</b></h4>
					    <p>Myfunc puts the calculations in the form of a straight line y =mx+c. The prediction uses the slope calculated, in this case the value of m to find the value of y. This is accomplished by using the stats.linregress which performs a linear least squares regression calculation on two arrays of values. 
					    </p>
				    <h4><b>Multiple Linear Regression</b></h4>
					    <p>This technique uses variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. In this scenario, the code provided utilizes the weight of the vehicle and the volume of the displacement in order to predict the CO<sub>2</sub> output level. The dependent variables are the weight and volume while the dependent variable is CO<sub>2</sub>.
					    </p>
				    <h4><b>Polynomial Regression</b></h4>
					    <p>Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis that allows for more complex patters or relationships to be made utilizing independent variables and also for predicting values. In this scenario for the code provided, contains two arrays for x and y values, where each value is mapped to create a curved line, with the x value indicating the time the vehicle passed and y the speed recorded at which the vehicle passed the booth. The value of r^2 indicates whether there is a relation and, in this scenario, a value of 0.94 indicates that there is a strong relationship in the model. This means that predictions can be made utilizing the regression model. 
					    </p>
				    <h4><b>Legal, Social, Ethical & Professional Issues that Machine Learning Professionals Will Encounter</b></h4>
				    <ul class="work__list">
				        <li>Legal<p>There are volumes of data available for individuals to utilize and learn from, however this does not mean that they can be used as a repository to train a data model without the publisher or authorâ€™s permission, especially those of copyrighted or protected data. There can be serious consequences associated with that from a legal background, ranging from jail time, to monetary fines, or even revoking of rights for data usage. Numerous websites and companies have incorporated a feature on their websites to prevent web scrapers from being able to collect data. </p></li>
				        <li>Social<p>The social consequences of gathering data stem from where the data is collected, in some instances individuals are unaware that they are being recorded, and what the purpose of these recordings are. There are numerous cameras recording individuals however majority are for security reasons, however if individuals are having their likeness recorded to be used in a data model, there would be objections throughout. It is imperative that individuals are aware and give permission for this to occur. </p></li>
				        <li>Ethical<p>There are many ethical considerations to be had when dealing with machine learning, many of which stem from bias and fairness. Unfortunately the data which a model may be trained upon may have inherent bias that was subconsciously achieved. In instances this like this, the model will not function correctly and it is imperative for the model to have this bias mitigated, by using diverse datasets when training is being done. In addition to diversity in the datasets, ongoing adjustments and monitoring should be the standard to overcome these biases, such as in facial recognition software where darker skin tones have a direct relation to higher error rates. </p></li>
				        <li>Professional-Professional issues which occur from the use of machine learning stem directly from the issue of individuals utilizing technology to accomplish all of, or majority of their work. In the instance of education and scholars, individuals can use machine learning, not to calculate results, but to write entire papers and submitting it as their own, unfortunately this relates to the first issue discussed, which constitutes the legal right to utilize the data, and the ethical right to use another individualâ€™s data and pass it off as their own, otherwise known as plagiarism.</li>
